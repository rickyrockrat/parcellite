.SH SYNOPSIS

[\fIOPTION\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBParcellite\fR is a lightweight GTK+ clipboard manager. This is a stripped down,
basic\-features\-only clipboard manager with a small memory footprint for those
who like simplicity.

\fBParcellite\fR features a clipboard CLI. Unrecognized options and the contents
of your standard input get copied to your clipboard. See \fBCLI EXAMPLES\fR.

.B Look at the tool tips by hovering over each item in the prefrences dialog.

Parcellite by default runs as daemon. In this mode \fBParcellite\fR will keep your clipboard
and primary contents safe.  It also displays the status Icon (depending on -n) and preferences.

Do not use status icon
.TP

Print clipboard contents
.B \-p\fR, \fB\-\-primary

.SH ACTIONS
\fBParcellite's\fR actions perform commands using the contents of your clipboard. "\fB%s\fR" in the command
is replaced with the clipboard contents. Use double quotes "\fB%s\fR" to expand env variables like $HOME to /home/your_name
Use single quotes '%s' to feed your action with env variables without shell expansion. Use %% if you want a literal %. 
See the man page for gnuC printf (man 2 printf) for more information.

.TP 
 'Show in Single line' does nothing.

 'Omit items' refers to omitting characters that don't fit in the history window width. This is for display only.

Use the Ctrl or Shift key in conjunction with right-click.
.TP
If you hold Ctrl, then it toggles the delete on a single item. 
.TP
If you hold Shift while holding down right-click (this is like a right-drag), then it toggles each item as it enters the item.

To complete the delete, hit enter.
