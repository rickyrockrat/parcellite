.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBParcellite\fR is a lightweight GTK+ clipboard manager. This is a stripped down,
basic\-features\-only clipboard manager with a small memory footprint for those
who like simplicity.

\fBParcellite\fR features a clipboard CLI. Unrecognized options and the contents
of your standard input get copied to your clipboard. See \fBCLI EXAMPLES\fR.

.B Look at the tool tips by hovering over each item in the prefrences dialog.

.SH ACTIONS
\fBParcellite's\fR actions perform commands using the contents of your clipboard. "\fB%s\fR" in the command
is replaced with the clipboard contents. Use double quotes "\fB%s\fR" to expand env variables like $HOME to /home/your_name
Use single quotes '%s' to feed your action with env variables without shell expansion. Use %% if you want a literal %. 
See the man page for gnuC printf (man 2 printf) for more information.
